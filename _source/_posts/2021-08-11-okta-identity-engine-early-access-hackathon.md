# Join the Okta Identity Engine Early Access Hackathon 2021 Challenge

*Amaze us! Build something unique and wonderful with early access to our new Okta Identity Engine Limited GA release. Here’s how you can get involved.* 

You’re invited to participate in the Okta Identity Early Access Hackathon, which is happening now! Our virtual hackathon began on August 3 and will run till September 14, 2021. You still have more than a month to take the new Okta Identity Engine (OIE) out for a spin and share your skills. We’ll have a total of USD $18,000 in prizes to distribute to the winners! Plus, cool swag prizes for our most supportive and collaborative hackers.  

## Rules, Requirements, and Prizes for the OIE Hackathon

Check out all the [**Hackathon details**](https://okta-hackathon-2021.devpost.com/) including rules, requirements, prizes, and how to register.  

We’ll provide early access to developer tools and documentation in pre-release for alpha testers and bold hackathon participants. This release unlocks a variety of customer identity and access management scenarios you can build into your apps, APIs, and CI/CD pipelines.

Your mission is to use the new Okta Identity Engine Limited GA release to create a working app (SPA, server-side, or mobile) using the new Okta Identity Engine developer platform. 

This challenge is your chance to push the platform beyond its boundaries and explore new possibilities. We’re eager to get feedback from developers at this early stage in the platform development process. 

## Resources for Hackathon Participants

In addition to giving you room to explore on your own, while knowing that we’ll also have help and resources readily available if you need them. 

In fact, developers who sign up to participate will receive:
- Onboarding on an Okta Identity Engine dev org 
- Documentation, guides, samples, and SDKs 
- Access to the Okta Dev Forum for support

We look forward to learning a ton by listening to your feedback and taking a close look at your working apps. [**Register now**](https://okta-hackathon-2021.devpost.com/) to build with Okta and securely connect the people and technologies that matter to you most. 

Thanks! We can’t wait to see what you make.
